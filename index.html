There, and throughout Latin America, bananas define the lives of countless people who bring spotless yellow bananas to our kitchen tables year-round for half the price of apples.

One day after feeling sick from his plane’s fumes, Acosta looked into the chemical he had been handling for so many years. Its name was Mancozeb, a known carcinogen banned in the U.S. and Europe but commonly used as a pesticide throughout Latin America.</p>

              <p>Two years ago, Acosta met with workers from El Empalme, a town in the province of Los Rios, Ecuador's number-one banana producing region. His message stuck with Javier Burgos, a plantation worker with a ready smile and emphatic handshake. Burgos started out selling ice cream at highway intersections. After his parents died in a car accident 15 years ago, he sought work in the fields to support himself. While his income was higher than that of a street vendor, he suffered long hours, inadequate pay, and mistreatment from supervisors.</p>
              <p>Burgos partnered with Acosta for seven years to bring awareness of the rights entitled to workers by international and local law, and ultimately build collective power to demand change in his community. His work came to an end in October 2014, when plantation authorities fired Burgos and several others after learning of their involvement in organizing. He had no choice but to return to the life of a hawker.</p>

              <h3>Finding Fair Trade</h3>
              <p>The Fair Trade movement aims to address the failings and injustices of international trade for workers like Javier and small farmers like Jimena. It seeks to give them access to lucrative global markets, the opportunity to receive a fair wage for their labor, a continuity of income and decent living and working conditions. The standard helps stabilize business for small producers by fixing a year-round price that allows the farmers to invest in their crops and budget their operation.</p>

              <p>The concept of Fair Trade gained ground in the American food industry primarily with coffee. The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in the creation of economic and political Fair Trade Organizations in response to the exploitation and US-instigated civil wars raging in Latin America nations. In 1986, Boston-based worker cooperative Equal Exchange became the first U.S. Fair Trade coffee company.</p>

              <p>In 1997, 14 small farmers in the town of El Guabo realized they could bypass middlemen and trade directly with consumers as a united, co-operative entity. A year later, after forming the association Asoguabo and linking up with a Dutch NGO named Solidaridad, the farmers sold their first container. Since then, Asoguabo has grown to 135 member farmers and exports 10 to 15 containers a week (about 10,000 bananas) to Europe and the United States through Fair trade importers Agrofair and Equal Exchange.</p>
              <p>Anibal Cabrera is one of those farmers. His eyes shine with pride as he talks about his organic agroforestry farm, three hectares of  banana and cacao plants on a steep mountain slope he inherited from his parents. Cabrera wakes up before dawn and works extra jobs to supplement his farm’s income. But he says he will have it no other way – running his own business has allowed him to accomplish childhood goals, like purchasing a truck before age 35 and supporting his two daughters’ education.</p>

              <p>Through the social premium, Asoguabo has supported a local health clinic and two schools for marginalized populations. Asoguabo logistics coordinator Vicente Ramirez experiences the impact of the social premium very personally, through what it brings to his youngest daughter Adriana.</p>

              <p>n the other side of the hemisphere from Asoguabo, Equal Exchange imports Fair Trade bananas. Equal Exchange's vision for Fair Trade sought to remedy a contentious history of banana trade that transformed Ecuador into the fruit’s number one exporter, providing 32 percent of the world’s bananas today.  The rise of multinationals at the turn of the 20th century converted much of Latin America into what <em>Esquire Magazine</em> in 1935 termed “banana republics,” or countries whose economies are largely dependent on exporting limited-resource products like bananas.  Today, five major multinationals dominate 80 percent of the banana market: Chiquita, Dole Fruit Company, Del Monte Fresh Produce, Noboa and Fyffes.</p>

              <p>Fair Trade bananas have been around in Europe since the late 1990s and make up nearly one third of the total banana business there.  Fair Trade roots in Europe make it much more of an easy market, in addition to the general culture around food in Europe; smaller scale agriculture, banned GMOs, and greater organic practices. Asoguabo exported its first container of bananas to the U.S. in 2005. Ten years later, Fair Trade bananas still only make up less than one percent of the total bananas consumed in the U.S. In spite of this, Equal Exchange is determined to bring bananas to American consumers.</p>

             <h3>Challenge 1: Organic</h3>
             <p>Ramón Sánchez is one of Asoguabo’s most productive farmers. His secret? Planting two different banana varieties in tighter rows. But Sanchez, who has been a member of Asoguabo for eight years, cannot sell a lot of his fruit: he is not certified organic. </p>
             <p>His three-hectare farm neighbors two large haciendas that regularly use aerial pesticide fumigation. While his own practices are organic, his plot’s proximity to pesticides makes it impossible for him to obtain the certification. As consumer demand for Fair Trade coincides with demand for organic, many small farmers who can only afford to grow conventional fruit risk losing their livelihoods.</p>

             <h3>Challenge 2: Competition and Authenticity</h3>
             <p>While still small, the Fair Trade market is growing and large multinationals are taking notice. Dole was the first U.S. multinational to get involved when it began its Fair Trade program in 2003. Four years later, Fair Trade USA certified two Dole plantations in Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Chiquita certified all its company-owned farms to <a href="http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/certification-verification">Rainforest Alliance standards</a> by 2012. While this indicates that big players are willing to set higher industry standards, Equal Exchange and Asoguabo believe multinational involvement threatens Fair Trade's original purpose.

             <div class="hr" style="width: 40em; height: 0.15em"><hr /></div>
             <p>“It’s incredibly different to buy from a small producer directly and to buy from a large company that is also certified Fair Trade,” Asoguabo President Fabiola Ramon said. “They are pushing us out of the scene as small producers. One day we might have to sell our business and farms because we won’t be competitive in comparison with large plantations and companies." Since certifier <a href="http://fairtradeusa.org/">Fair Trade USA</a> proposed to accept plantations within Fair Trade international standards in 2003, Equal Exchange has boycotted and decried Fair Trade USA's certification.</p>

             <p>Fair Trade USA proposed allowing large plantations into the Fair Trade system primarily to benefit plantation laborers. In the face of low wages and chronic exploitation, workers gain power, respect and development funds through Fair Trade pricing and the premium.</p>
             <p>“Fair Trade is about addressing rural poverty around the world,” explains Hannah Freeman, director of floral and produce at Fair Trade USA. “If the idea is that there’s only a fixed pie, we’re only going to be able to sell one million pounds of Fair Trade bananas every year...The question is, 'Can we grow this market to fit everyone?'”</p>
             <p>For Equal Exchange, changing the structure of the market means shifting where supply is sourced rather than polishing the status quo. As Nicole Vitello puts it, the primary function of Fair Trade is not labor advocacy or union organizing. Through creating alternative systems, the Fair Trade model has a compelling potential to reach workers and renegotiate their place within the supply chain.</p>
             <p>At the end of the day Asoguabo is a business, and plantations and smoother supply chains entering its domain is naturally threatening. They will adapt to the market as it evolves, but it’s up to consumers to decide what they want Fair Trade to mean.</p>

             <h3>Challenge 3: Panama Disease</h3>
             <p>Regardless of certification or size, banana farms are up against a biological threat ravaging banana plants worldwide.

             <div class="hr" style="width: 40em; height: 0.15em"><hr /></div>
             <p>“It could be tomorrow, it could be five years,” says Koeppel, who has been tracking the march of Panama Disease since the 1990s. “This fungus will wipe out the Cavendish eventually. So the real answer is to stop putting all your bananas in one basket.” For Asoguabo and small producers, how to respond to this looming threat is all but unclear.</p>
