              <p>soguabo’s vision for Fair Trade sought to remedy a contentious history of banana trade that transformed Ecuador into the fruit’s number one exporter, providing 32 percent of the world’s bananas today.  The rise of multinationals at the turn of the 20th century converted much of Latin America into what <em>Esquire Magazine</em> in 1935 termed “banana republics,” or countries whose economies are largely dependent on exporting limited-resource products like bananas.  Today, five major multinationals dominate 80 percent of the banana market: Chiquita, Dole Fruit Company, Del Monte Fresh Produce, Noboa and Fyffes.</p>

              <p>Beyond unstable economies, banana republics suffered rampant labor, human and environmental rights violations to workers on large plantations.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in the creation of economic and political Fair Trade Organizations in response to the exploitation and US-instigated civil wars raging in Latin America nations.

              <p>Ecuador’s first small banana farmer co-operative, Asoguabo, was the first organization to export bananas under fair trade standards in the world. In 1997, Asoguabo’s 14 founders realized they could bypass middlemen and directly trade with consumers as a united, co-operative entity. A year later, after linking up with a Dutch NGO named Solidaridad, Asoguabo sold its first container. Since then, it has grown to 135 member farmers and exports 10 to 15 containers a week to Europe and the United States through Fair trade importers Agrofair and Equal Exchange. That means 135 small farmers are harvesting 10,000 bananas and shipping them across the world every week of the year on their own terms. </p>

              <p>Fair Trade also promotes sustainable development. It works toward this goal by adding one "premium" dollar to the price paid to farmers for each box of bananas. This money, called the social premium, is assembled into a common community fund that producer members control. They decide during quarterly general assemblies on how to spend it on various social projects. Asoguabo has used its funds to build a health clinic in the village and support two schools.</p>

              <p>On the other side of the hemisphere from Asoguabo, Equal Exchange imports Fair Trade bananas. As a “model for how things can be different,” in the words of co-founder Rink Dinkerson, Equal Exchange is a mission rather than profit-driven business. Asoguabo coordinates many fragmented parts of the supply chain - port entry, ripening, distribution etc. - and this importing process can be vulnerable, costly and uneven. In contrast, multinationals own the different parts (containers, ships, ripening chambers, trucks, etc.) that go into transporting bananas from South America to stores across the U.S., and large volumes of sales help them absorb costs easily. Equal Exchange’s operation is a lot riskier--the company lost nearly $1 million in its first two years doing bananas.</p>
              <p>Equal Exchange started as a fair trade coffee company in the late 1980s but has since expanded to products like tea, chocolate, avocados and bananas. Founded by three food co-operative workers in Boston, Equal Exchange has grown into a business whose sales exceed $60 million every year. The company is 100 percent employee owned and governed on a one-person/one-share/one-vote basis, and up to 10 percent of its net profit is donated to non-profit organizations and small-farmer co-ops. Their goal is to show that a radically different model of trade can be fair and profitable to all players in a supply chain, as embodied in their mission:</p>
              <p><i>To build long-term trade partnerships that are economically just and environmentally sound, to foster mutually beneficial relationships between farmers and consumers, and to demonstrate through our success the contribution of worker co-operatives and Fair Trade to a more equitable, democratic and sustainable world.</i></p>

              <p>Although hugely successful in coffee, Equal Exchange has struggled with bananas. As the most popular fruit, supermarkets make up for bananas’ cheap price point through volume sold. Bananas are known as the lost leader throughout the industry that keeps their price artificially low. Supermarkets consider bananas as the benchmark item that consumers look at when deciding where to shop.</p>
              <p>“The whole fundamental issue of the banana, the business model is it’s the cheapest fruit,” says banana expert and author Dan Koeppel. “It’s been thought that a dollar a pound is as high as consumers are willing to go…But the banana probably has to cost $1.29 a pound for it to be a practical, profitable product.”</p>
              <p>In Fair Trade however, volumes are much lower and the cost of production higher. A Fair Trade banana company doesn’t have economies of scale: it buys from small groups whose supply can be inconsistent, and it trades a difficult perishable fruit along a fragmented supply chain. Oké USA barely covers its costs, let alone makes a profit, so lowering the price of its bananas past 99 cents a pound is very difficult.</p>
              <p>While consumers have been accustomed and grown willing to pay $4 for the luxury item that is a cup of Fair Trade coffee, they are used to paying 39 cents a pound for the staple bananas. To Koeppel, the challenge is that Fair Trade bananas are not differentiated enough from conventional ones to compel average consumers to pay more. He calls the Cavendish banana the “McDonalds hamburger of fruit: it’s cheap, and terrible. But if McDonalds quadrupled the price of their hamburger to pay workers more, most people would say, ‘I’m not going to buy a McDonalds hamburger for three dollars, I can buy a much better hamburger with that kind of money.’”</p>
              <p>Fair Trade bananas have been around in Europe since the late 1990s and make up nearly one third of the total banana business there.  Fair Trade roots in Europe make it much more of an easy market for Fair Trade, in addition to the general culture around food in Europe; smaller scale agriculture, banned GMOs, and greater organic practices. European consumers are more organized and ready to demand better practices from their food suppliers than American ones.  Asoguabo exported its first container of bananas to the U.S. in 2005. Ten years later, Fair Trade bananas still only make up less than one percent of the total consumed bananas in the U.S.</p>
              <p>In spite of all this, Equal Exchange is determined to bring bananas to American consumers.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know that if at the end of the day this will succeed or this is the right fight to be fighting, or if Equal Exchange should really be doing bananas or should be doing more coffee products where it’s more of a conducive model, it’s not so much pressure and so unlikely to succeed,” says Nicole Vitello, CEO of Oké USA. “But then I’m like, well if Equal Exchange doesn’t do it, who does then?”</p>

             <p>The upsurge of labels in the food industry has confused consumers, who have grown suspicious of the truth behind the “Organic” and “Fair Trade” buzzwords. When it comes to the supermarket’s cheapest fruit, 99 cents Fair Trade bananas have been relegated to niche markets like natural food or co-op stores where Fair Trade has also come to signify organic. As the healthy, alternative food market grows, multinationals and plantations have started to break into the fair trade market, posing competition and controversy in the Fair Trade world. And as Equal Exchange hopes to grow demand for Fair Trade bananas, the best way to scale up while not compromising the values of this alternative model has yet to be found. In this next section, explore the different challenges facing the Fair Trade banana supply chain.</p>
