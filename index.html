                <p>anana field after banana field line the road leading to El Guabo. You get there from Machala, the capital of Ecuador’s southwestern region of El Oro. Machala is a city made of unpainted buildings, motorbike exhaust, and grimy Chinese restaurants. The banana capital of the world, it is one of the main ports through which most of the world’s exported bananas pass. Every September, Machala hosts the annual International Banana Festival during which local farmers compete for the largest banana stalk while women from banana-producing Latin American countries compete for the title of Reina del Banano, or Banana Queen.</p>

                <p>East of Machala, buildings abruptly give way to banana plants blanketing all land in sight. The town of El Guabo stands out like an island tucked between deep green plantations and low-hanging clouds. This quiet concrete oasis breaking the leafy horizon is home to the world’s first Fair Trade banana organization--every week through the Association of Small Producers of El Guabo (Asoguabo), 154 organized small farmers harvest and ship ten tons of Fairtrade bananas to the U.S. and Europe. They are living out the vision of 14 Ecuadorian farmers from the late 1990s to build a fairer market and carve a place for small producers within the global banana industry.</p>

              <p>lthough ubiquitous, the banana beholds many mysteries to American consumers. Before continuing to the story of Asoguabo, take some time to get to know the surprising facts and history behind America’s favorite fruit, or skip to the rest of the narrative.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The bananas grown for export that populate our supermarket shelves are of the Cavendish variety. There are over 1,000 alternate varieties on earth.</li>
                <li>Americans consume a massive volume of bananas: nearly 30 pounds per capita per year, according to a FAO report from 2012. Less than two percent of those are Fair Trade.</li>
                <li>Five major companies dominate 80 percent of the banana market. Chiquita (Brazil-owned), Dole Fruit Company (US owned), Del Monte Fresh Produce (Mexican-UAE owned), Noboa (Ecuador-owned), Fyffes (Irish-owned).</li>
                <li>India and Brazil produce the most bananas but most of those stay within the domestic market.</li>
                <li>Most bananas in the US come from Guatemala, but Ecuador is the world’s number one exporter, providing 32 percent of the world’s bananas. The US imports 4.3 million tons of bananas each year.</li>

              <p>While the banana industry has moved away from its bloody involvement in coups and civil wars in the 1970s, it retains aspects of this legacy today.</p>
              <p>Still, labor, human and environmental rights violations continue to exist in banana plantations that Koeppel calls Cavendish factories, with rampant practices such as below-minimum pay, impediments to unionizing, use of dangerous chemicals with no protective equipment, indecent and unhygienic living quarters for migrant workers, child labor, etc. In Ecuador, many banana worker communities live under constant violation of their human, labor and environmental rights.</p>

Meanwhile, the official price set by the government every quarter averages $6.20 for conventional and $8.30 for organic. Small producers are often vulnerable and fear isolation from intermediaries.</p>

              <p>The concept of Fair Trade gained ground in the American food industry primarily with coffee. The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in the creation of economic and political Fair Trade Organizations in response to the exploitation and US-instigated civil wars raging in Latin America nations. The standard helped stabilize business for small producers by fixing a year-round price that allows farmers to invest in their crops and budget their operation.</p>

              <p>Ecuador’s first small banana farmer co-operative, Asoguabo, was the first organization to export bananas under fair trade standards in the world. In 1997, Asoguabo’s 14 founders realized they could bypass middlemen and directly trade with consumers as a united, co-operative entity. A year later, after linking up with a Dutch NGO named Solidaridad, Asoguabo sold its first container. Since then, it has grown to 135 member farmers and exports 10 to 15 containers a week to Europe and the United States through Fair trade importers Agrofair and Equal Exchange. That means 135 small farmers are harvesting 10,000 bananas and shipping them across the world every week of the year on their own terms. </p>

              <p>Fair Trade also promotes sustainable development. It works toward this goal by adding one "premium" dollar to the price paid to farmers for each box of bananas. This money, called the social premium, is assembled into a common community fund that producer members control. They decide during quarterly general assemblies on how to spend it on various social projects. Asoguabo has used its funds to build a health clinic in the village and support two schools.</p>

              <p>On the other side of the hemisphere from Asoguabo, Equal Exchange imports Fair Trade bananas. As a “model for how things can be different,” in the words of co-founder Rink Dinkerson, Equal Exchange is a mission rather than profit-driven business. Asoguabo coordinates many fragmented parts of the supply chain - port entry, ripening, distribution etc. - and this importing process can be vulnerable, costly and uneven. In contrast, multinationals own the different parts (containers, ships, ripening chambers, trucks, etc.) that go into transporting bananas from South America to stores across the U.S., and large volumes of sales help them absorb costs easily. Equal Exchange’s operation is a lot riskier--the company lost nearly $1 million in its first two years doing bananas.</p>
              <p>Equal Exchange started as a fair trade coffee company in the late 1980s but has since expanded to products like tea, chocolate, avocados and bananas. Founded by three food co-operative workers in Boston, Equal Exchange has grown into a business whose sales exceed $60 million every year. The company is 100 percent employee owned and governed on a one-person/one-share/one-vote basis, and up to 10 percent of its net profit is donated to non-profit organizations and small-farmer co-ops. Their goal is to show that a radically different model of trade can be fair and profitable to all players in a supply chain, as embodied in their mission:</p>
              <p><i>To build long-term trade partnerships that are economically just and environmentally sound, to foster mutually beneficial relationships between farmers and consumers, and to demonstrate through our success the contribution of worker co-operatives and Fair Trade to a more equitable, democratic and sustainable world.</i></p>

              <p>Although hugely successful in coffee, Equal Exchange has struggled with bananas. As the most popular fruit, supermarkets make up for bananas’ cheap price point through volume sold. Bananas are known as the lost leader throughout the industry that keeps their price artificially low. Supermarkets consider bananas as the benchmark item that consumers look at when deciding where to shop.</p>
              <p>“The whole fundamental issue of the banana, the business model is it’s the cheapest fruit,” says banana expert and author Dan Koeppel. “It’s been thought that a dollar a pound is as high as consumers are willing to go…But the banana probably has to cost $1.29 a pound for it to be a practical, profitable product.”</p>
              <p>In Fair Trade however, volumes are much lower and the cost of production higher. A Fair Trade banana company doesn’t have economies of scale: it buys from small groups whose supply can be inconsistent, and it trades a difficult perishable fruit along a fragmented supply chain. Oké USA barely covers its costs, let alone makes a profit, so lowering the price of its bananas past 99 cents a pound is very difficult.</p>
              <p>While consumers have been accustomed and grown willing to pay $4 for the luxury item that is a cup of Fair Trade coffee, they are used to paying 39 cents a pound for the staple bananas. To Koeppel, the challenge is that Fair Trade bananas are not differentiated enough from conventional ones to compel average consumers to pay more. He calls the Cavendish banana the “McDonalds hamburger of fruit: it’s cheap, and terrible. But if McDonalds quadrupled the price of their hamburger to pay workers more, most people would say, ‘I’m not going to buy a McDonalds hamburger for three dollars, I can buy a much better hamburger with that kind of money.’”</p>
              <p>Fair Trade bananas have been around in Europe since the late 1990s and make up nearly one third of the total banana business there.  Fair Trade roots in Europe make it much more of an easy market for Fair Trade, in addition to the general culture around food in Europe; smaller scale agriculture, banned GMOs, and greater organic practices. European consumers are more organized and ready to demand better practices from their food suppliers than American ones.  Asoguabo exported its first container of bananas to the U.S. in 2005. Ten years later, Fair Trade bananas still only make up less than one percent of the total consumed bananas in the U.S.</p>
              <p>In spite of all this, Equal Exchange is determined to bring bananas to American consumers.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know that if at the end of the day this will succeed or this is the right fight to be fighting, or if Equal Exchange should really be doing bananas or should be doing more coffee products where it’s more of a conducive model, it’s not so much pressure and so unlikely to succeed,” says Nicole Vitello, CEO of Oké USA. “But then I’m like, well if Equal Exchange doesn’t do it, who does then?”</p>
