              <p>soguabo’s vision for Fair Trade sought to remedy a contentious history of banana trade that transformed Ecuador into the fruit’s number one exporter, providing 32 percent of the world’s bananas today.  The rise of multinationals at the turn of the 20th century converted much of Latin America into what <em>Esquire Magazine</em> in 1935 termed “banana republics,” or countries whose economies are largely dependent on exporting limited-resource products like bananas.  Today, five major multinationals dominate 80 percent of the banana market: Chiquita, Dole Fruit Company, Del Monte Fresh Produce, Noboa and Fyffes.</p>

              <p>Beyond unstable economies, banana republics suffered rampant labor, human and environmental rights violations to workers on large plantations.

              <h3>Ecuador today</h3>
              <p>While the banana industry no longer partakes in bloody coups and civil wars like it did in the 1970s, it still suffers the consequences today.</p>
              <p>Jorge Acosta knows these legacies well—a trained pilot, he spent 17 years fumigating banana plantations in Ecuador.  One day after feeling sick from his plane’s fumes, Acosta researched the chemical he had been handling for so many years.  Its name was Mancozeb, a known carcinogen banned in the U.S. and Europe but commonly used as a pesticide throughout Latin America.</p>
              <p>Enraged, Acosta abandoned the comfortable life of a pilot and turned to defend the workers in the fields below.  Today he organizes communities to fight violations like below-minimum pay, impediments to unionizing and lack of protective equipment.</p>

              <p>Two years ago, Acosta met with workers from El Empalme, a town in the province of Los Rios, Ecuador's number-one banana producing region. His message stuck with Javier Burgos, a plantation worker with a ready smile and emphatic handshake. Burgos started out selling ice cream at intersections but after his parents died in a car accident he sought work in the fields to support himself. While his income was higher than that of a street vendor, he suffered long hours, inadequate pay, and mistreatment from supervisors.</p>
              <p>Burgos partnered with Acosta for seven years to bring awareness of the rights entitled to workers by international and local law, and ultimately build collective power to demand change in his community. In October 2014, however, plantation authorities fired Burgos and several others after learning of their involvement in organizing. He had no choice but to return to the life of a hawker.</p>

The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in the creation of economic and political Fair Trade Organizations in response to the exploitation and US-instigated civil wars raging in Latin America nations.

              <p>In 1997, 14 small farmers in the town of El Guabo realized they could bypass middlemen and trade directly with consumers as a united, co-operative entity. A year later, after forming the association Asoguabo and linking up with a Dutch NGO named Solidaridad, the farmers sold their first container. Since then, Asoguabo has grown to 135 member farmers and exports 10 to 15 containers a week (about 10,000 bananas) to Europe and the United States through Fair trade importers Agrofair and Equal Exchange. </p>

Cabrera wakes up early and works extra jobs to supplement the income from his small farm. He says he will have it no other way—running his own business has allowed him to accomplish personal goals, like purchasing his truck before age 35, and work towards others, like supporting his two daughters in obtaining professional degrees. </p>

              <p>Fair Trade also promotes sustainable development. It works toward this goal by adding one "premium" dollar to the price paid to farmers for each box of bananas. This money, called the social premium, is assembled into a common community fund that producer members control. They decide during quarterly general assemblies on how to spend it on various social projects. Asoguabo has used its funds to build a health clinic in the village and support two schools.</p>

              <p>On the other side of the hemisphere from Asoguabo, Equal Exchange imports Fair Trade bananas. As a “model for how things can be different,” in the words of co-founder Rink Dinkerson, Equal Exchange is a mission rather than profit-driven business. Asoguabo coordinates many fragmented parts of the supply chain - port entry, ripening, distribution etc. - and this importing process can be vulnerable, costly and uneven. In contrast, multinationals own the different parts (containers, ships, ripening chambers, trucks, etc.) that go into transporting bananas from South America to stores across the U.S., and large volumes of sales help them absorb costs easily. Equal Exchange’s operation is a lot riskier--the company lost nearly $1 million in its first two years doing bananas.</p>
              <p>Equal Exchange started as a fair trade coffee company in the late 1980s but has since expanded to products like tea, chocolate, avocados and bananas. Founded by three food co-operative workers in Boston, Equal Exchange has grown into a business whose sales exceed $60 million every year. The company is 100 percent employee owned and governed on a one-person/one-share/one-vote basis, and up to 10 percent of its net profit is donated to non-profit organizations and small-farmer co-ops. Their goal is to show that a radically different model of trade can be fair and profitable to all players in a supply chain, as embodied in their mission:</p>
              <p><i>To build long-term trade partnerships that are economically just and environmentally sound, to foster mutually beneficial relationships between farmers and consumers, and to demonstrate through our success the contribution of worker co-operatives and Fair Trade to a more equitable, democratic and sustainable world.</i></p>

              <p>Although hugely successful in coffee, Equal Exchange has struggled with bananas. As the most popular fruit, supermarkets make up for bananas’ cheap price point through volume sold. Bananas are known as the lost leader throughout the industry that keeps their price artificially low. Supermarkets consider bananas as the benchmark item that consumers look at when deciding where to shop.</p>
              <p>“The whole fundamental issue of the banana, the business model is it’s the cheapest fruit,” says banana expert and author Dan Koeppel. “It’s been thought that a dollar a pound is as high as consumers are willing to go…But the banana probably has to cost $1.29 a pound for it to be a practical, profitable product.”</p>
              <p>In Fair Trade however, volumes are much lower and the cost of production higher. A Fair Trade banana company doesn’t have economies of scale: it buys from small groups whose supply can be inconsistent, and it trades a difficult perishable fruit along a fragmented supply chain. Oké USA barely covers its costs, let alone makes a profit, so lowering the price of its bananas past 99 cents a pound is very difficult.</p>
              <p>While consumers have been accustomed and grown willing to pay $4 for the luxury item that is a cup of Fair Trade coffee, they are used to paying 39 cents a pound for the staple bananas. To Koeppel, the challenge is that Fair Trade bananas are not differentiated enough from conventional ones to compel average consumers to pay more. He calls the Cavendish banana the “McDonalds hamburger of fruit: it’s cheap, and terrible. But if McDonalds quadrupled the price of their hamburger to pay workers more, most people would say, ‘I’m not going to buy a McDonalds hamburger for three dollars, I can buy a much better hamburger with that kind of money.’”</p>
              <p>Fair Trade bananas have been around in Europe since the late 1990s and make up nearly one third of the total banana business there.  Fair Trade roots in Europe make it much more of an easy market for Fair Trade, in addition to the general culture around food in Europe; smaller scale agriculture, banned GMOs, and greater organic practices. European consumers are more organized and ready to demand better practices from their food suppliers than American ones.  Asoguabo exported its first container of bananas to the U.S. in 2005. Ten years later, Fair Trade bananas still only make up less than one percent of the total consumed bananas in the U.S.</p>
              <p>In spite of all this, Equal Exchange is determined to bring bananas to American consumers.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know that if at the end of the day this will succeed or this is the right fight to be fighting, or if Equal Exchange should really be doing bananas or should be doing more coffee products where it’s more of a conducive model, it’s not so much pressure and so unlikely to succeed,” says Nicole Vitello, CEO of Oké USA. “But then I’m like, well if Equal Exchange doesn’t do it, who does then?”</p>

             <p>The upsurge of labels in the food industry has confused consumers, who have grown suspicious of the truth behind the “Organic” and “Fair Trade” buzzwords. When it comes to the supermarket’s cheapest fruit, 99 cents Fair Trade bananas have been relegated to niche markets like natural food or co-op stores where Fair Trade has also come to signify organic. As the healthy, alternative food market grows, multinationals and plantations have started to break into the fair trade market, posing competition and controversy in the Fair Trade world. And as Equal Exchange hopes to grow demand for Fair Trade bananas, the best way to scale up while not compromising the values of this alternative model has yet to be found. In this next section, explore the different challenges facing the Fair Trade banana supply chain.</p>

             <h3>Challenge 1: Organic</h3>
             <p>Ramon is one of Asoguabo’s most productive producers. He inherited his farm from his father and made it three times as productive after receiving training from a Costa Rican agronomist. His secret: planting two different types of bananas in tighter rows. While very proud of his accomplishments, he is facing a major challenge directly caused by consumer choice in the United States: he is not certified organic. His three-hectares farm neighbors two large haciendas that regularly aerially fumigate their fields. While his practices on his own plot are organic, the proximity of his farm to pesticides makes it impossible for him to get the certification. This means he is obligated to sell his fruit for $2 less than he could. In order to gain the certification, he would need to create a natural barrier and make his farm smaller. He doesn’t have the capital or the land to afford such an investment, so he prefers to wait it out until his neighbors switch to organic production. Unfortunately, his fruit goes to waste sometimes because demand for conventional Fair Trade fruit is so low. While he has chosen to remain with Asoguabo out of solidarity and for the better year-round prices, many farmers in his situation in the area have been forced to sell their farms and abandon their business. While Asoguabo is pushing for their producers to all go organic, they hope the demand will meet them somewhere in the middle while they transition.</p>

             <h3>Challenge 3: Panama Disease</h3>
             <p>Asoguabo will eventually have to face the reality of the Panama disease beginning to ravage banana plantations all over the world. The plant fungus known as Fusarium Wilt already decimated the dominating type of commercial bananas in the 1960s, and its re-emergence is threatening to eradicate the Cavendish.</p>
             <p>When the banana industry had to expand across countries to meet growing demand, a fungus that rendered plantations completely fallow hit Panama. At this time, the type of banana exported commercially was the Gros Michel, a larger, tastier banana with thicker skin that could be transported unboxed in large ships. The virulent fungus wiped out the Gros Michel variety in a couple of decades, so that by 1960 it was functionally extinct. Standard Fruit, today’s Dole, experimented with the Cavendish whose only advantage was that it had resisted Panama Disease. It was a much more delicate fruit that also tasted much worse. Dole came up wit the technology to bag, box, protect, gas and refrigerate bananas. But a new strain of Panama Disease, Tropical Race 4, emerged and spread in Asia in the 1990s and has since expanded to Australia and Africa.</p>
             <p>“The question is, is it going to come to Latin America? And the answer is yes,” says Koeppel who has been tracking the march of TR4 across the world since the 1990s. “It could be tomorrow, it could be five years. This fungus will wipe out the Cavendish eventually, and it will take 20, 30 or 50 years to do it. So the real answer is to stop relying on a Cavendish monoculture, to stop putting all your bananas in one basket.” Mention how it’s transmitted.</p><p>For Asoguabo and small producers, how to respond to this looming threat is all but unclear.
